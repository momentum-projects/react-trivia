# React Trivia Game

For this project, you will use React to build a trivia game powered by [the Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).

This project does not include any wireframes: you will have to design the game yourself.

One way to implement this is to present the user with a list of categories. A user can choose a category, and then answer questions within that category. But that's not the only way you could do this. Use your creativity!

## How to start

You will need to spend time exploring the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) to see what kind of data you are working with and the different options that the API gives you. This might give you some ideas for things you want to do in your application.

[Wireframe](https://balsamiq.com/learn/articles/what-are-wireframes) your design before you start building and think about how your user will interact with your application (note that wireframing is about organization and functionality, not about styling).

Figuring out what you want the user to see and do will help you plan the components you need. You may want to start with one big component that you then break down into smaller ones. A good way to think about this: each component should have one job.

After you have created the React application, your first task should be getting categories to show up on the page. Then, give your user a way to select a category and see questions for that category.

From there, think about what the user wants to do next. What will they see and do? How will the application respond to their interactions?

## Requirements

- When the application loads, a user can see a list of possible trivia categories so that they can choose one to start a quiz in that category.
- A user can select a category and start a quiz in that category. A quiz should have at least 10 questions in it.
- A quiz shows the user one question at a time, with its possible answers.
- The possible answers for a question are shown in a random order so that the correct answer isn't in the same place every time.
- A user can select an answer to a question and can see some visual feedback that they selected an answer.
- After a user completes a quiz, they can see how many questions they answered correctly, or some kind of score, when they have answered all the questions in a category. (Optionally, show them which questions they got right and which ones they got wrong.)
- After a user selects their intended answer, they are shown the next question in the category.
- The application should make use of 3 or more components.
- The application should have two or more "screens." In a traditional web application, we'd think of these as different pages.
- The application uses React's state to manage data.
- The application uses the Open Trivia Database API.
- The application is styled in a way that enhances its usability and functionality.
- Pick at least one one spicy option from the list.

## üå∂Ô∏è Spicy Options

Once you have the minimum functionality, you should implement as many spicy options as you have time for. You're also welcome to implement something not on this list.

- Add a [loading indicator](https://uxplanet.org/progress-indicators-4-common-styles-91a12b86060c) so that your UI shows something other than a blank screen while your data is being retreived from an AJAX request.
- Allow users to customize their quiz by choosing how many questions they want to answer and/or choosing a difficulty level.
- Consider using [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store scores so that they will still be there if the page is reloaded.
- Create a win condition and some way to indicate that a user has won. You might want to explore awarding badges, animations or something delightful like [react-confetti](https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti).
- Use animations for interactions and/or transitions. There are many different React animation libraries you could try, but here are a few of the most widely used: [React Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion), [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring), [React TsParticles](https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles), [React Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion), [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)
- Integrate a timer into your trivia application. For example, you could impose a time limit on answering questions and mark a question wrong if there is no guess before the timer runs out. Or, you could see how many questions your user can answer in a certain amount of time. Consider using local storage to store times and show the user their personal best times.
- Implement a social share feature so your user can easily share their score on social media. This could be as fancy or straightforward as you want it to be.
- Use any React library that looks interesting to you. [Here are some things to browse through](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react). [Here are some more](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components).

## About the API

You can learn about the Open Trivia Database API at [this API config page](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).

Some things you are likely to want to do:

- Get list of categories: https://opentdb.com/api_category.php
- Get 10 questions: https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10
- If you add a session token you won't receive the same question twice
    - Get a token: https://opentdb.com/api_token.php?command=request
    - Add a token to a request: `&token=YOURTOKENHERE`
